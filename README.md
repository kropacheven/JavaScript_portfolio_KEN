 FSJS6 project - static Node.js and Express JavaScript portfolio

 This is my portfolio site showcasing the projects I've build during studying 
 Full Stack JavaScript Techdegree at Treehouse. The site contains main landing page,
 about page and a set of pages separetely dedicated in more detail to each of the projects.

 The app is build using dynamic page representation to the user with help of Node.js, Express and Pug. JSON file is used as a sourse of projects data. Node modules are not loaded on GitHub.
 When the user types wrong URL route error is being handled by middleware. 

 Technologies used: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node.js with Express and Pug, npm as package manager.

 Final extra touches to CSS are added: profile header background color and text color are changed, profile thumbnail picture is a bit scaled with ease transition when hovered over.
