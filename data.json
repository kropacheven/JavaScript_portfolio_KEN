A player continues to select letters until they guess the phrase (and win), or make five incorrect guesses (and lose). If the player completes the phrase before they run out of guesses, a winning screen appears. If the player guesses incorrectly five times, a losing screen appears. A player can guess a letter only once. After they have guessed a letter, this letter is disabled on the onscreen keyboard.",
